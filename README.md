## Tutorial

* Build towers (cost 100) with left click in tower mode
* In Tower Mode: Move selector / Ghost Tower near the entrance Circle of camp and press E to lock on
* After locking: Press left click to accept kill quest (the requested camp for you to destroy is marked red in the top left)
* After fulfilling the quest (destroy all buildings and the entrance Circle of the marked camp) this camp does not attack you any more
