## Project History

- started dev in the context of a Game Design course at university (first six month)
- many experiments with program structure and style
- graphics are all created in-game
- now mainly used to explore interesting facets of Game Dev (but it should still be fun for a few rounds)

## Architecture

I strife for a layered architecture, where dependencies only go downward and the general execution order of the main functions is upwards.
