    </h1>
    <p>
      During the development of CGAA the differences between normal software
      development and game development became very apparent to me, so the
      development was a huge learning experience. <br />
      This lead to me spending a lot of time on experimenting in and researching
      certain areas of the game, even if they would not all be visible to the
      player. <br />
      The following is a recounting of what I did in these areas and more
      importantly what I learned there. <br />
      In other words: <br />
      The top 6 development time-sinks that might not be obvious from playing
      CGAA.

    <h2 id="1-frameworks-versus-engines">1. Frameworks versus Engines</h2>
    <p>
      From the beginning of development, the concept of CGAA included a short
      playtime and a low barrier to entry. For this reason, it made sense to
      make it a browser game, because in this way everyone could play it. Phaser
      is one of the most used and well known frameworks to develop browser games
      with, so it was the natural choice. <br />
      I wanted to use a framework and not an engine, because my goal was to
      spend most of my development time programming and not searching for
      options in an editor. A framework mostly tries to deliver buildings block
      while also giving structural guidance how the resulting software should be
      architected. An engine is more high level, as it usually includes editors
      and further developer tooling as well as a generally unified developer
      experience for game creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      CGAA being my first real game, the proportions of the qualitative
      difference between frameworks and engines was unclear to me at the
      beginning of the development. Before choosing Phaser I made sure that it
      had examples, that there was documentation and that the community was
      still alive if I had questions. However, during development I discovered
      that besides the building blocks for games, Phaser really mostly offered
      loose suggestions how to structure your games (use scenes, use game
      objects etc.) and I had the feeling that I spent a lot of time
      re-inventing the wheel instead of building another bicycle. <br />
      In the end I think Phaser is a mixed bag for first time game developers.
      It provides all the necessary building blocks, but upon intensive
      inspection the documentation is incomplete, there are no complex examples
      and without knowledge of game programming patterns, I was going in circles
      a lot of the time when it came to structuring the source code which lead
      to a lot of time spent refactoring.
    </p>
    <h2 id="2-shapes-graphics-and-collision">
      2. Shapes, Graphics and Collision
    </h2>
    <p>
      In CGAA the most important shape is the circle. For this and other basics
      shapes like the rectangle, Phaser offers an API. Because the design of
      CGAA is minimal, it was natural to try to generate all graphics in-game.
      The workflow for this is to first draw a shape, then capture it and save
      it as a texture and then add the animation frames to the texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/graphicgeneration.png"
        alt="Graphic Generation example"
      />
    </p>
    <p>In the case of a circle texture, the frame-step would look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript"><div><span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.scene.textures.list[<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.title].add(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.radius, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.radius);
<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.scene.textures.list[<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.title].add(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.radius, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.radius, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.radius);
</div></code></pre>
    <p>
      This approach was very convenient, because it mostly avoided needing to
      ship additional assets, input-ouput problems from graphic programs or
      pixel errors. The hard part was finding the correct APIs and hardcoding
      the basic measurements for the shapes without an immediate visual
      feedback. <br />
      This worked fine for basic shapes and even for more complicated combined
      shapes like the chain-weapon I found a solution by reusing the polygon
      shapes that I implemented for collision detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      For collision and overlap detection I used the most performant and
      simplest physics engine of Phaser: Arcade. The design of the game did not
      demand more complex physical operation, so this choice was obvious. <br />
      However, the drawbacks where that only circles and rectangles were
      supported by Arcade and the chain-weapon consisted of a more complex
      shape: the arrow. To allow for this kind of collision detection I
      implemented polygon shapes and a separate collision detecion system, that
      would only be activated when a unit was attacking and then would
      synchronize the textures position (e.g. the weapon) with the corresponding
      polygon shape to calculate if a collision happend (in hindsight it might
      be more performant to approximate all the parts of the weapon separately
      with basic circles and rectangles). For the polygon based collision I
      tried out many different libaries (e.g. that used the Separating Axis
      Theorem) and due to huge differences in how the coordinates are
      interpreted, I setled for the one library that was compatible and wrote
      missing cases (e.g. collision of circle with circle) myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img

        alt="Weapon Collision"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the development progressed it became more and more tedious to
      hand-adjust the measurements of the shapes and complex shapes like the
      chain-weapon took nearly a week of fulltime work to get right, including
      the animations (this also had to do with Phasers weird interpretation of
      angles). <br />
      It also became clear that trying to enhance the graphics (e.g. rounding
      the edges of towers to make them more distinct from walls) would not be
      feasible with this approach. <br />
      At the end of the development I came to the conclusion that a more
      classical approach (e.g. using an extra graphics program) might have been
      better suited or a hybrid approach where the generation of graphics is a
      pre-processing step which allows to hand-adjust fine details.
    </p>
    <h2 id="3-performance-optimization">3. Performance Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      Webpages are very performance sensitive, because the platform is
      inherently restricting how many resources can be used. This means, that to
      implement even a comparatively simple game computation needs to be
      minimized. <br />
      Early in development I already ran into bottlenecks when it came to
      physics calculation. Analyzing the performance in the Chrome Developer
      Tools, one of the culprits turned out to be my line of sight mechanic,
      where the enemies can spot the player and other units if they are to close
      and attack them. The towers also had a line of sight mechanic but
      implementing these two different physics hitbox/area types lead to a huge
      drop in the framerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/towercircle.png"
        alt="Tower and Circle Line of Sight"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution was to use just one line of sight area in the moving units
      and to implement the tower line of sight in the loop that gets executed
      when other units are entering the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/onlycircle.png"
        alt="Circle Line of Sight"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      With this at least one third of line of sight areas could be reduced. This
      improvement and many other smaller improvements (e.g. using arrays and
      sets instead of objects where possible, optimizing access and other types
      of algorithms in physics heavy hot paths), the framerate was stable in
      normal situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at certain points in the game, when new towers were build or new
      units spawned, I again noticed pretty severe framerate drops. This was the
      case because I was creating new objects and because of the way the
      JavaScript heap works, this lead to increased computation. I could solve
      this by using a concept from Game Programming Patterns,
      <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html"
        >the Object Pool</a
      >, where I created all the objects that I needed for the game at the start
      and held them in standby and then just reused the same objects again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/objectpool.png"
        alt="Object Pool"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      For this I need to implement my own Object Pools as the interface for the
      Phaser Object Pools were not suited to my already written code. After fine
      tuning the amount of objects to create in the beginning and generally
      reducing the amount of objects/units used, I finally achieved a reasonable
      performance in every game state. Further improvement would probably
      require a new implementation of
      <a href="#Shapes,-Graphics-and-Collision">my collision detection</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4-ai-from-fsm-to-linked-lists">4. AI: From FSM to Linked Lists</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to game AI a Finite State Machine is often used to implement
      complicated behavior. In the case of CGAA this also was my first choice.
      However, after a while it became apparent that my informal approach to FSM
      (states include informal sideffects that can impact other states) lead to
      a few critical bugs (e.g. units running into walls leading to huge drops
      in framerate) and the complexity of my bug fixes became to much for my
      simple use case. So I could have re-implemented my FSM with a FSM
      framework to formalize all the cases or find a simpler solution.
    </p>
    <p>

        alt="Informal FSM"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      I choose to re-think my AI and implement a simple system based on a kind
      of Linked List.

    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpINOFQ32o0"
        >Naughty Dogs list-based Action-System</a
      >, I abstracted my AI as an array of planned actions that a unit wants to
      fulfill. <br />
      If one action is complete, it alerts the array holder and the next planned
      action is started. <br />
      If the unit is interrupted during an action (e.g. the player is in attack
      range or the wave unit gets attacked before it reaches its destination),
      the action is made into a kind of linked list. A new dynamic action is
      created that deals with the interruption. This new action is linked to the
      interrupted action and is the new first entry in the “linked list” and
      once the new action is finished it notifies the old action and makes that
      action the first entry in the list again.
    </p>
    <h2 id="5-functional-javascript-to-object-oriented-typescript">
      5. Functional JavaScript to Object Oriented TypeScript
    </h2>
    <p>
      When starting the development, I envisioned the randomized game map as a
      computation problem that would be suited to a functional approach. It went
      through different phases that could be modeled as semi-pure functions that
      used the input of the respective previous functions. <br />
      A simplified example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>f() = Calculate middle points of Camps</li>
      <li>g() = Calculate wall positions of Camps</li>
      <li>h() = Calculate randomized building positions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By composing these functions I could then generate the Game Map. <br />
      However, it became clear that partial or intermediate values from this
      composition where needed for other purposes. For example the exits of
      Camps, which are used to determine where not to place walls, where needed
      for path calculation and placing of the diplomat circles. <br />
      Including these values in the outputs of the functions lead to huge Map
      Objects being passed around. <br />
      When it became apparent that a few of the results would need to be
      accessed and changed by the Game Units (e.g. modifying the
      0-1-representation of the Game Map), I converted most of the functions to
      objects and the results and partial results to fields on those objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/funccomp.png"
        alt="Functional/Object comparison"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      I also converted the code base to Typescript as the amount of implicit
      types of objects was steadily growing and needed to be managed somehow.
      <br />
      Making all the needed data available could have been achieved with a
      functional style, e.g. by decomposing the code into smaller functions.
      <br />
      However, when looking at a minimal definition of object-orientation (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"
        >objects are fields and procedures, programs are interacting objects</a
      >) it became clear that this approach most closely mapped to my mental
      model of a real-time game (interacting units with changing state) and that
      is why I decided to shift my strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end only the parts of the games computation remained functional,
      where it was easy to see that there was no dynamic change necessary. For
      example the initial programmatic generation of all textures or the
      creation of the animation frames.
    </p>
    <h2 id="6-ui-modes-to-clicks">6. UI: Modes to Clicks</h2>
    <p>
      3D games often switch between different modes of interaction via button
      press. For example drawing a weapon in an RPG means switching to attack
      mode and then switching between weapons. <br />
      One of the influences for CGAA was &quot;Orcs Must Die!&quot; where the
      player can switch between Towers or Traps by using different keyboard
      buttons. Naturally the first controls for CGAA followed this schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="file:////home/hel/Dropbox/Projekte/Master/WS1920/GameDesign/GameJS/md/keyboard.png"
        alt="Keyboard Controls"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      After playtesting this with different groups of players (people with
      gaming experience to non-gamers), it was obvious that this was not going
      to work. While for me the different modes were obvious and I was able to
      use them to build towers very fast and interact with the diplomats, for my
      playtesters this was just confusing and most of them even did not figure
      out that you could interact with the diplomats at all. <br />
      During my research I found out that Computer Scientists like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry Tesler</a>
      already argued against using Modes in User Interfaces in the seventies
      because of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(user_interface)#Mode_errors"
        >known harmful effects</a
      >
      they can have. Tesler, who co-invented the modern understanding of
      copy-paste, argued that Click-based UI was the better alternative. <br />
      When looking at mode based tools like vim, it seems that Modes might be
      appropriate mostly in systems that are used by experts and my game was
      certainly not intended to need expert knowledge to play it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature on User Experience Design finally provided the hint, that
      the best User Interfaces fulfill the users expectations. In the case of
      CGAA, the main difference to Orcs Must Die! is that it is top-down and
      therefore the Tower Defense mechanics are not really similar. Top-down
      Tower Defense usually follows the UI of real-time strategy games (RTS)
      where you can click to build and click to select. RTS mostly works with
      what I call &quot;selection bars&quot; that pop up when a unit is selected
      and that provide further options to interact. This is in fact so intuitive
      that it does not need illustration because almost every popular
      wide-spreed Software works like this. <br />
      Using this paradigm, I rebuilt the UI to feature clickable units and a
      clickable build menu. While the current UI is not perfect (mostly because
      I still have the switch between attack and interact mode - the mouse click
      is overloaded), it is a huge improvement on the purely mode based version.
