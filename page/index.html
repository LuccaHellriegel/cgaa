										Circle Gladiator Army Arena (CGAA) combines 2D action with Tower Defense to achieve a unique blend

								<b>
									Play the story of a young, rebellious circle that faces the challenging task of defending his new
									found blue friends against multiple camps of blue-hating aggressors. Can you convince them to stop or
									do they need to feel the power of your towers? <br />
									The king watches you fight for your life from his guarded chamber and laughs. But once all the camps
									are conquered, he will know that he messed with the wrong circle!
